	<!-- 3. format the lyrics below into paragraphs  -->

		<p><em>Just</em> a small town girl<br />
		Livin' in a lonely world<br />
		She took the midnight train<br />
		Goin' anywhere<br />
		Just a city boy<br />
		Born and raised in South Detroit<br />
		He took the midnight train<br />
		Goin' anywhere<br />

		A singer in a smokey room<br />
		The smell of wine and cheap perfume<br />
		For a smile they can share the night<br />
		It goes on and on and on and on<br />

		<strong>Strangers</strong> waiting<br />
		Up and down the boulevard<br />
		Their shadows searching<br />
		In the night<br />
		Streetlight people<br />
		Livin' just to find emotion<br />
		Hidin' somewhere in the <small>night</small></p><br />
